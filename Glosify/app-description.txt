The app will have a UI that is inspired by Spotify
On the left side there will always be a treeview where quizzes will be shown and they can be arranged in folder
Quiz = Playlist
When you click a quiz its words will be shown on the right side
Word pair = Song 
Every word can have a clickable base word that will show a page with data about the word 
base word = artist 
In the quiz/playlist view, the user can enable shuffle and other option for the quiz
The user can then click the play button and the playlist view will be replaced by the quiz
